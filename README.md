## Project Description
This is a Node CLI that takes in information about a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

```
As a manager

I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info

so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles

```

## Usage

The application will be invoked and run in terminal.

The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns.

When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user, and save it in output folder.
